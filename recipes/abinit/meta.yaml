about:
    description: 'ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total
        energy, charge density

        and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and nuclei (molecules
        and periodic solids)

        within Density Functional Theory (DFT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave
        or wavelet basis.

        ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT
        forces and stresses,

        or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these forces, or to generate
        dynamical matrices,

        Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors, based on Density-Functional
        Perturbation Theory,

        and many more properties. Excited states can be computed within the Many-Body
        Perturbation Theory

        (the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation), and Time-Dependent
        Density Functional Theory

        (for molecules). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different utility programs
        are provided.
